1038. Jewels And Stones
中文English
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example
Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Notice
S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

    /**
     * @param J: the types of stones that are jewels
     * @param S: representing the stones you have
     * @return: how many of the stones you have are also jewels

    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<J.length();i++){
            for(int j=0;j<S.length();j++){
                if(J.charAt(i)==S.charAt(j))
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
