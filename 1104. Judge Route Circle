1104. Judge Route Circle
中文English
Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place finally.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example
Example 1:

Input: "UD"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "LL"
Output: false

//public class Solution {
    /**
     * @param moves: a sequence of its moves

        int countD=0;
        
        for(int i=0;i<moves.length();i++){
